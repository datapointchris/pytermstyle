"""Terminal rendering for the Python CLIs: color palette, section header, help grammar.

The bash CLIs share ``~/.local/shell/formatting.sh`` and the Go CLIs share
``gotermstyle``; this is the third rendering of the same house style, and the
parallel is the point. Colors are raw ANSI so any consumer can import this
without pulling a dependency of its own, and the codes match what the other two
emit, so a Python screen and a bash screen sitting next to each other on PATH
are indistinguishable.

The help grammar mirrors ``formatting.sh`` function for function, so a
``show_help`` reads the same in either language::

    help_header('menu labs', 'Small experiments worth revisiting.')
    help_usage('menu labs <verb>')

    help_section('Commands')
    help_row('menu labs list', '', 'List every lab')
    help_row('menu labs show', '<id>', 'Show one lab')

    help_end()

``help_row`` buffers rather than printing, so the flush can size the description
column from the longest row in the section. No call site passes a width or a
color. Close a screen with ``help_end``, and use ``help_text`` rather than
``print`` for prose between rows so pending rows flush ahead of it.

There is deliberately no ``dim`` — see standards/cli-design.md, which rules
it out for being unreadable against half the terminal themes in use.

Two constraints are deliberate, and are constraints rather than oversights.

**One help screen per process.** The grammar keeps its buffered rows and section
state in module-level globals, so two screens rendered concurrently in one
process would interleave. Every consumer is a one-shot CLI rendering a single
screen, which is what makes the globals affordable, and the alternative — a
``Screen`` object respelled at every call site — costs the grammar the prose-like
reading that is its whole appeal, and forks the API away from the bash and Go
counterparts. Tests that render several screens reset the state between them.

**The palette is resolved once, at import.** ``COLOR = color_enabled()`` runs on
import, so ``NO_COLOR`` set afterwards has no effect: set it, or ``FORCE_COLOR``,
*before* importing. The constants are consumed by direct f-string interpolation
(``print(f'{CYAN}{title}{RESET}')``) throughout every consumer, so blanking the
constants is the only gate that reaches those call sites without rewriting all of
them. It also keeps the padding arithmetic honest either way, since widths are
measured on the uncolored text already. The palette resolves to empty strings
when nothing will render them, so ``<tool> --help > notes.txt`` writes text
rather than escape sequences.
